> ### What is a CSV file?

A comma-separated values file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a row and the comma separated values are the cell-content in the row. A line break indicates the next row in the file.

CSV files can are a more programmatically inclined way of representing spreadsheets and manipulating them. 

When opened in a spreadsheet reader, each line is a row and each comma represent the next cell in the row.

They give us a way of storing values from a program and document and visualize the stored file in a better way. 



> ### Repo status:

Only implementation in [python](./python/csvManipulator.py) is done.
